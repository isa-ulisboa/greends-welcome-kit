# Welcome Kit - Master in Green Data Science
Master in Data Science in Agriculture, Food, Forest and Environment, Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa

## Welcome

Welcome to **[Master in Green Data Science](https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/ensino/mestrados/mcdaafa/lp/)**! This welcome kit will help you to set up your environment and get ready to start your master programme. We will use a set of common tools and resources across all mandatory courses, which includes:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebooks
3. Google Collaboratory
4. Google Drive
5. Git
6. Github

As a studend of this course, you will have access to the Informatics Room 48 (Sala PORBIOTA, Main Building) at ISA were desktop computers will be prepared with all the necessary tools. However, you might want to setup your on computer (laptop or desktop) to work off class, or also on class, if you prefer so. This will be necessary to complete homework and assingments. 

All of these resources are available for Linux, MacOS or Windows, so you can choose which developer environment you want to use. We will support all of them. We will also rely heavily on online services for colaboration and sharing, so you will have to set them up as well.


### 1. Python

We will use **python** as our primary programming language through out the course. Pyhton is on of the most used programming languages worldwide, and very popular within the Data Science community.

Python is an opensource and free software, which is most certainly available to be installed from the apps/package manager in your system. Or you can go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) to download installation packages.

### 2. Jupyter Notebook
