# Master in Green Data Science - Welcome Kit
### Master in Data Science in Agriculture, Food, Forest and Environment
### Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa


## Welcome

Welcome to **[Master in Green Data Science](https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/ensino/mestrados/mcdaafa/lp/)**! This welcome kit will help you to set up your environment and get ready to start your master programme. We will use a set of common tools and resources across all mandatory courses, which includes:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebooks
3. VPN
4. Google for Education account
5. Google Collaboratory
6. Git
7. Github
8. Text editor

As a student of this course, you will have access to the Informatics Room 48 (Sala PORBIOTA, Main Building) at ISA where desktop computers will be prepared with all the necessary tools. However, you might want to setup your on computer (laptop or desktop) to work off or on class, if you prefer so. This will be necessary to complete homework  exercises and assingments.

All of these resources are available for free for Linux, MacOS or Windows, so you can choose which developer environment you want to use. We will support all of them. We will also rely heavily on online services for colaboration and sharing, so you will have to set them up as well. Some resources may require on-campus connections, in which case you need to have a VPN connection.


### 1. Python

We will use **python** as our primary programming language through out the course. Pyhton is on of the most used programming languages worldwide, and very popular within the Data Science community.

Python is an opensource and free software, which is most certainly available to be installed from the apps/package manager in your system. Or you can go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) to download installation packages.

It is also recommended to have a package manager for Python installed. These can by [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or Conda. Pip is normally installed  by default if python was downloaded from pyhton.org. You can ensure that it is installed with the following command:
```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
For more details, check [pip installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 2. Jupyter Notebook

[**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) is a web-based interactive computing platform to create notebook documents. Notebooks combine code, text and visualisation that you run interactively to perform your operations in a data science project. Jupyter is a opensource and free software that uses python, but can run notebooks with code implemented in python, R or other languages.

To [install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), you need to have Python in your system. The recommended way of installation is using [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (Pyhton Package Index), which needs also to be installed.

To install Jupyter Notebook, run from a terminal:

```
pip install notebook
```

After the installation completed, you can start the application from a terminal by running:

```
jupyter notebook
```


### 3. VPN

Some resources might be available only when you are in an on-campus connection. In that case, if you are working remotely from home, you need to have an active VPN connection. ISA provides VPN connections to all its students. You can find more information on how to configure your connection [here](https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/di/servicos/acesso-vpn). To activate your VPN access, you need to deliver a signed [term of responsability](https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/files/di/pub/docs/formularios/TermoResponsabilidadeVPN.pdf) at ISA Informatics Support office (Main Building, room 28A).


### 4. Google for Education account

As a student of the University of Lisbon, you have access to a **ULisboa User Account**, which will enable several services and resources, including a **Google for Education** account. We will use several application of this service in our classes, so you need to activate the Google account before classes start. The services in this account include Gmail, Google Drive, Google Classroom, Google Calendar, Google Collaboratory, Google Jamboard, etc.

Activate your ULisboa account at https://utilizador.ulisboa.pt. This will also require that you activate your ISA student email in advance. In case you need support, contact the Informatics Support at ISA by helpdesk@isa.ulisboa.pt. 


### 5. Google Collaboratory

One of the Google for Education resources we will use is **Google Collaboratory**. This is an online *Jupyter Notebook* environment that enables running notebooks in a cloud environment. Google Colab provides cumputing resources (including GPU processors), allows sharing of notebooks and access to files stored in Google Drive, so it is a great environment for our data science projects. In fact, most of our Jupyter Notebook projects will be run in Colab.

You need to have your Google for Education account active to sign in in Colab.


### 6. Git

**Git** is a *distributed version control* system that will help you to manage and share your code between computers, with colleages and the data science community. We will use *git* in our projects to start from a template repository, develop our code, do hands on exercises, submit homework and assingments. When using *Google Colab*, you will also have the possibility to share your code using *git* and *Github*.

You can install **Git** in your computer, from the apps/package manager of your system, or downloading from https://git-scm.com. In the classroom we will learn how to configure *git* and the essencial commands to start using it.


### 7. GitHub

**Github** is a code repository that enables sharing code between developers. It supports *git* commands to grab or submit code, and manages versions. You will use *Github* in many tasks to manage your projects, get and submit code.

To use Github, you need to [create and account](https://github.com/signup), which is available for free.


### 8. Text editor

One of the most used tools by you will be a text editor. It will be used to view and edit code, data files, documentation, etc. You can use any editor of your choice, depending on the operating system you have. Examples are: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/),[ Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (if you're using linux or MacOS, the last one is likely to be already available in your system).
